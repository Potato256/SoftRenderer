## Why Write a Software Renderer?

There are several advantages to writing a software renderer:

* It's simple! You don't have to deal with GPUs, CUDA, or a real graphics API. This makes it a great way to learn about rendering pipelines without being overwhelmed by the complexities of hardware and APIs.
* It's interesting! Writing a software renderer allows you to dive deep into the rendering pipeline and experiment with different techniques.
* It's challenging! Implementing even basic features from scratch can be time-consuming and require a deep understanding of computer graphics.
* You have complete control! Writing a software renderer is perfect for research and experimentation because you have total control over every detail.

To be fair, there are also some disadvantages:

* It will be very slow and impractical compared to a hardware-accelerated renderer.
* You will miss the opportunity to practice using a graphics API like OpenGL or DirectX.


Overall, this is a place for learning, practicing, and having fun with PBR!
